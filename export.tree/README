EEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer Interface: offline training to induce target emotional states.
Description: This dataset accompanies the publication by Daly et al. (2018) and has been analysed in Daly et al. (2015) (please see Section 5 for full references). The purpose of the research activity in which the data were collected was to train a music brain-computer interface system to induce specific affective states for individual users. For this purpose the participants listened to music clips (40 s) targeting two affective states, as defined by valence and arousal. Data were recorded over 3 sessions (separate days), each containing 4 runs (same day) of 18 trials each. The music clips were generated using a synthetic music generator. The dataset contains the electroencephalogram (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data from 16 healthy participants while listening to the music clips, together with the reported affective state (valence and arousal values) and auxiliary variables.

This dataset is connected to 2 additional datasets: 

1.	EEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer Interface: system calibration. doi:

2.	EEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer Interface: online real-time control. doi:

Please note that the number of participants varies between datasets; however, participant codes are the same across all three datasets.

4. CONTENTS
------------

The dataset comprises data from 17 subjects, stored using the BIDS format. The sampling rate is 1 kHz and the music listening task corresponding to a music clip is 40 s long (clip duration). During the first 20 s, the music clip targets emotional state A, while for the remaining 20 s the music clip targets emotional state B.
